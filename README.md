# RTTR-Portable

Return to the Roots official websites: <br />
[official github](https://github.com/Return-To-The-Roots/s25client) <br />
[official website](https://www.siedler25.org/) <br />

In this project, I packed Return to the Roots and all Libraries needed into a single executable. <br />

You need the original settlers 2 gold edition DATA and GFX folders to play rttr! <br />
Download the latest release of [RTTR-Portable](https://github.com/Farmer-Markus/s25-RTTR-Portable/releases/latest) <br />
To build executable, extract Build-RTTR-Portable.zip and copy DATA, GFX of your original settlers installation into "dwarfs/Original-Settlers-2/". <br />
To build, run ./build.sh and the script should be created. <br />
./Settlers-2-RTTR-Portable.sh --help shows all commands you can use. <br />

I want to make portable apps with all includet dependencies like: <br />
[Lutris-Portable](https://github.com/Farmer-Markus/Lutris-Portable) <br />
[Settlers 2 RTTR-Portable](https://github.com/Farmer-Markus/ATLauncher-Portable/) <br />
